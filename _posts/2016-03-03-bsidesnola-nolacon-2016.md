scheduled for April 16, 2016, you may want to book your room soon to avoid last minute reservation fees!

[NolaCon 2016](https://nolacon.com) is scheduled for May 20-22, 2016, and **DC225** is proud to announce that two of our members
will be speaking this year! [YOU PASS BUTTER: NEXT LEVEL SECURITY MONITORING THROUGH PROACTIVITY](https://nolacon.com/session/pass-butter-next-level-security-monitoring-proactivity/)
will be presented by our very own [cry0](https://nolacon.com/speaker/cry0/) and [s0ups](https://nolacon.com/speaker/s0ups/)!

We are also planning to have a table set up this year at NolaCon with more information about DC225 and our upcoming news and events,
so stop by and say hi if you make the conference this year!
