DEF CON 225 held it's 2017 Q1 meetup tonight, and here is a recap of the event

### Safe-cracking

A DC225 member brought a personal safe he could no longer open due to the digital keypad being broken. Attempts were made to open the safe by shorting out some of the wires, but eventually it was pried open. We were then able to examine how the locking mechanism worked, and where some weak points could lie in the system.

### Web App Challenge

DC225 featured a web based application designed to challenge the user's knowledge in web page manipulation.
